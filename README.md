> :warning: **This repository has been moved**: To make development easier this plugin's code was moved to [EvidentlyCube/TW5-PluginShowcase](https://github.com/EvidentlyCube/TW5-PluginShowcase/tree/main), specifically [here](https://github.com/EvidentlyCube/TW5-PluginShowcase/tree/main/plugins/EvidentlyCube/TW5-TaskList) .

## Features

A very powerful Task List/Todo plugin where you can customize almost any aspect of it:
 * Define your own fields
	* Simple text input fields
	* Select powered by Data tiddlers or list fields
 * How the list items are displayed
 * Sorting
 * CSS class applied to each element

Additionally you can make it so that each task list item has custom tags or fields added on save for maximum power.

**To use** just create a new tiddler with the tag `TaskList` and use the built-in builder.
